Fitting the data

Wonderful text about fitting things.

Reference/API
=============

.. note::
   I had tried to split this up manaully, but let's see what
   automodapi thinks of the module. The ``IterFit`` and
   ``StatInfoResults`` classes are not exported, so how best
   to document them? I think the best thing is to actually
   get them exported rather than manually adding them as
   shown below.
   
.. automodapi:: sherpa.fit

.. autoclass:: sherpa.fit.IterFit

   :undoc-members:
